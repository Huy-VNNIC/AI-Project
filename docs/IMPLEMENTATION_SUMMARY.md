# Software Effort Estimation System - Implementation Summary

## Components Implemented

1. **ML Requirement Analyzer** (`ml_requirement_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes software requirements using NLP and ML techniques
   - Extracts features needed for effort estimation
   - Falls back to traditional NLP if advanced models aren't available

2. **Model Integration** (`model_integration.py`) 
   - Integrates multiple estimation models
   - Selects the best model based on project characteristics

3. **Effort Estimation Service** (`effort_estimation_service.py`)
   - Provides comprehensive estimation service
   - Combines requirement analysis, estimation, reporting, and team suggestion

4. **API Server** (`run_estimation_service.py`)
   - Exposes REST API endpoints for estimation and analysis
   - Provides health checks, estimation, team suggestions
   - Production-ready with Waitress WSGI server

5. **Service Integration** (`service_integration.py`)
   - Connects with task management systems
   - Handles estimation requests and responses

6. **Feedback System**
   - **Feedback API** (`feedback_api.py`) - Provides endpoints for submitting and retrieving feedback
   - **Feedback Collector** (`feedback_collector.py`) - Stores and processes feedback data
   - **Feature Extractor** (`feedback_feature_extractor.py`) - Extracts features from feedback data
   - **Model Retrainer** (`model_retrainer.py`) - Retrains models with feedback data
   - **Scheduled Retraining** (`scheduled_retraining.py`) - Automates the retraining process

## API Endpoints

The system provides the following API endpoints:

### Core Estimation Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint with service status and model information
- `POST /api/estimate` - Estimate effort based on requirements text
- `POST /api/team` - Suggest team composition based on requirements
- `POST /api/analyze` - Analyze requirements and extract features

### Feedback System Endpoints
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback on actual effort after project completion
- `GET /api/feedback/stats` - Get statistics about submitted feedback
- `GET /api/feedback-overview` - Get detailed overview and insights from feedback data

## Usage

1. **Setup and Installation**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Download spaCy model
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

2. **Running the Service**
   ```bash
   # Start the service
   ./run_estimation_service.sh
   
   # With custom port
   ./run_estimation_service.sh --port 8080
   ```

3. **API Usage Example**
   ```bash
   # Estimate effort
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"requirements":"The system shall provide user authentication functionality. Users must be able to register, login, and reset passwords."}' \
        http://localhost:5000/api/estimate
   ```

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture:

1. **Input Layer**: Requirements document processing
2. **Analysis Layer**: NLP/ML-based feature extraction
3. **Estimation Layer**: Multi-model integration for effort prediction
4. **Output Layer**: REST API for integration with other systems

## Frontend Integration

The Next.js frontend has been enhanced with:

1. **Feedback Dashboard Page**
   - Path: `/feedback`
   - Shows model performance metrics and feedback statistics
   - Allows submission of actual effort data after project completion

2. **API Integration**
   - React hooks for data fetching and submission
   - API routes for proxying requests to the AI service
   - Comprehensive error handling and loading states

3. **UI Components**
   - Statistics display with accuracy metrics
   - Submission form for actual effort data
   - Model improvement tracking
